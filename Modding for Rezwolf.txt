Rezwolf is designed to extend modding support while staying close to ecwolf, and as such ive added some useful features

Borderlock - Mapinfo feature (in gameinfo section)
Enable with `lockborder = 1`
Locks the border to maximum (20-21), allows for floating hud

Itemscount - Mapinfo feature (in gameinfo section)
Set this to an actor name to use that actor for items counter
Example:
`itemscount = "MacTreasureItem`
If not set then will default to mactreasureitem

Timer - Latchcfg + mapinfo feature
This is a timer (obviously)
Use timerx timery timerdigits timerenabled in LATCHCFG
In a level info section you can set:
`timercountdown = true` This will make the timer count down until it reaches par time
`timerendactor = "BombExplosion"` This is the actor to spawn when time runs out and countdown is enabled
The timerendactor will spawn at the players position
